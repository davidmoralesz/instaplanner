# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** March 21, 2025

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Instaplanner, a static web application designed to help you plan your Instagram posts. This Privacy Policy outlines how I handle your data within the application.

## 2. Information I Collect

Instaplanner is a static web application that primarily operates within your browser. **I do not collect any personal data on our servers.** All information you enter into Instaplanner, such as post descriptions, images, and scheduling details, is stored locally in your browser's local storage.

- **Local Storage:** Instaplanner utilizes local storage to save your data. This allows you to retain your plans and drafts between sessions. This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to any external servers, including Cloudflare Pages servers.

## 3. How I Use Your Information

Because all data is stored locally, I do not use your information for any purpose beyond the functionality of the Instaplanner application within your browser.

- **Application Functionality:** Your locally stored data is used to display, edit, and manage your Instagram post plans.

## 4. Data Sharing

Since Instaplanner does not transmit any data to our servers, I do not share your information with any third parties.

## 5. Data Security

- **Local Storage Security:** While local storage provides a convenient way to store data, it's important to understand that its security is dependent on the security of your browser and device.
- **No Server-Side Storage:** Because there is no server-side storage, there is no risk of your data being compromised on our servers, including Cloudflare Pages servers.

## 6. Use by Minors

Instaplanner is not intended for use by minors of any age.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. I will post any changes on this page. Your continued use of Instaplanner after any changes indicates your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
